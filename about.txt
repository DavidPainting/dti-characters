Drawn to Imperfection: About This Project

These conversations are designed to invite you into deeper engagement with God through biblical characters who are often misunderstood, sidelined, or silenced.

They speak from their memories as recorded in the scriptures and from the re-telling of those found in their chapter of the book. The voices you encounter do not attempt to represent historical ethnicity or speech, but aim to carry the emotional weight and tone of each character’s experience. 

They will not only tell you about their lives and experiences but will invite you to share yours - and will respond from their knowledge of God and His compassion.

We invite you to ask questions, to listen, to wonder — and perhaps to hear something new in stories you thought you already knew.

___________________________________


As with all artificial intelligence based interactions, be aware that responses may be inaccurate.
All conversations remain private between you and the character unless you download and share them
The characters do have boundaries designed to protect and will withdraw from offensive or abusive conversations. In such cases access rights will be revoked.
