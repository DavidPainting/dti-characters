Drawn to Imperfection: About This Project

These conversations are designed to invite you into deeper engagement with biblical characters who are often misunderstood, sidelined, or silenced.

The voices you hear do not attempt to represent historical ethnicity or speech, but aim to carry the emotional weight and tone of each character’s experience. We’ve chosen from the best currently available options, and we look forward to using more diverse voices as they become available.

We invite you to ask questions, to listen, to wonder — and perhaps to hear something new in stories you thought you already knew.
